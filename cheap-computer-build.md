# cheap-computer-build

I was able to create this PC build for ~$400, which is a steal compared to [similarly spec'ed COTS options](https://www.newegg.com/p/pl?N=100897449%20601195636&Order=PRICE)

## Components

[Dell Optiplex MT](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2334524.m570.l1313.TR4.TRC0.A0.H0.Xoptiplex+9010+mt.TRS0&_nkw=optiplex+9010+mt&_sacat=0&LH_TitleDesc=0&_sop=15&_osacat=0&_odkw=optiplex+90+mt&LH_BIN=1 ), bought for the enclosure/motherboard/processor.  I got a Dell Optiplex 9010 MT because it had a descent processor, 2 PCI slots (for 2 graphics cards), and high memory capability.

[Spec sheets like this](https://i.dell.com/sites/csdocuments/Shared-Content_data-Sheets_Documents/en/aa/Dell_OptiPlex_9010_spec_sheet.pdf  ) can still be found to get the full information on a Dell computer

[Compatible memory](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=m570.l1313&_nkw=PC3-12800U+DDR3+Dell+Optiplex+9010&_sacat=0  ), I got 4x8GB

[solid state drive](https://www.newegg.com/p/pl?N=100011693%20600038492%20600038502%20600038519&d=solid%20state&Order=PRICE ), I got 500GB since it was a good price to size ratio.  [Additional drive](https://www.newegg.com/p/pl?N=100167523%20600003298  
) to store non-speed-essential items, I went with a 1TB

[Graphics card](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_nkw=1070&_sacat=0&LH_BIN=1&_sop=15), I got a used 1070 because it was a good price for the performance.  There are also some [uncomfortably cheap 1050Ti's](https://www.ebay.com/itm/GTX1050-750Ti-970-960-1-2-4GB-Memory-GDDR5-HDMI-Graphics-Card-for-NVIDIA-GeForce/202706305731?hash=item2f323cc2c3%3Am%3AmijheVp1STfJf8pgU4Ix6qw&LH_BIN=1 ), if you're a risk taker

[Power supply](https://www.newegg.com/Power-Supplies/Category/ID-32  ), I was able to catch a Gold standard 650W one for $60, which I think would be able to handle 2 1070 graphics cards.  The power supply I got was oversized, so I had to remove the cover latching mechanism for it to fit, and just used a bolt/nut instead to hold the cover on.

## Additional options

Note that for a second graphics card to fit in the Optiplex 9010, the bottom of the case would have to be dremeled off, which I may play with at one point

Also the Optiplex 9010 has an [Intel Q77 Express chipset](http://www.cpu-upgrade.com/mb-Intel_(chipsets)/Q77_Express.html), so the [i7-3770K](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_nkw=i7-3770K&_sacat=0&_sop=15) seems to be the best processor the computer can support.  Another strategy is to buy a cheaper PC with a worse processor, along with a separate compatible higher performance processor.
