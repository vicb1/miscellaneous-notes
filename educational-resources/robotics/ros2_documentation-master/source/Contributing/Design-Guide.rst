Design Guide: Common patterns in ROS 2
======================================

Composable nodes as shared libraries
------------------------------------

**Context**

You want to export composable nodes as a shared libraries from some packages and using those in another package that does link-time composition.

**Solution**


* Add code to the CMake file which imports the actual targets in downstream packages

  * Install the generated file
  * Export the generated file

**Example**

FastRTPS large data transfer
----------------------------

**Context**

You want to transfer large data via FastRTPS.

**Problem**

DDS/RTPS uses UDP with a maximum message size of 64k

**Solution**

Configure the middleware that it fragements large data into messages

**Implementation**

Use Asynchronous publication mode:

.. code-block:: bash

   <publishMode>
     <kind>ASYNCHRONOUS</kind>
   </publishMode>

FastRTPS Best Effort Video Streaming
------------------------------------

**Context**

You want to transfer video streams and provide up to date data. It is ok to loose some packages.

**Problem**

Acknowledged data transmission mechanisms prevent from being able to provide
up to date packages.

**Solution**

Use "best effort" communication (instead of the usual acknowledgement based
mechanism) and prioritize the last frame.

**Implementation**

* Configure "best effort" reliability mechanism
* Configure Quality of service history to keep last frame

.. code-block:: bash

   <reliability>
     <kind>BEST_EFFORT</kind>
   </reliability>

   <historyQos>
     <kind>KEEP_LAST</kind>
     <depth>1</depth>
   </historyQos>

FastRTPS Reliable Video Streaming
---------------------------------

**Context**

You want to transfer video streams in unreliable network settings.

**Solution**

Use a reliable communication mechanism. Use fast response by writer and reader.

**Implementation**

* Configure "reliable" reliability mechanism
* Configure NACK reponse delay and suppression duration of writer to 0
* Configure heartbeat response delay of reader to 0

.. code-block:: bash

   <reliability>
     <kind>RELIABLE</kind>
   </reliability>

   # writer
   <times>
     <nackResponseDelay>
       <durationbyname>ZERO</durationbyname>
     </nackResponseDelay>
     <nackSupressionDuration>
       <durationbyname>ZERO</durationbyname>
     </nackSupressionDuration>
   </times>

   # reader
   <times>
     <heartbeatResponseDelay>
       <durationbyname>ZERO</durationbyname>
     </heartbeatResponseDelay>
   </times>
