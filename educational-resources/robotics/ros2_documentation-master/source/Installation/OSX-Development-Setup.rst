   :local:

System requirements
-------------------

We support OS X 10.12.x.

However, some new versions like 10.13.x and some older versions like 10.11.x and 10.10.x are known to work as well.

Install prerequisites
---------------------

You need the following things installed to build ROS 2:


#.
   **Xcode**


   *
     If you don't already have it installed, install Xcode and the Command Line Tools:

     .. code-block:: bash

        xcode-select --install

#.
   **brew** *(needed to install more stuff; you probably already have this)*:


   * Follow installation instructions at http://brew.sh/
   *
     *Optional*: Check that ``brew`` is happy with your system configuration by running:

     .. code-block:: bash

        brew doctor

     Fix any problems that it identifies.

#.
   Use ``brew`` to install more stuff:

   .. code-block:: bash

       brew install cmake cppcheck eigen pcre poco python3 tinyxml wget

       # install dependencies for Fast-RTPS if you are using it
       brew install asio tinyxml2

       brew install opencv

       # install dependencies for rcl_logging_log4cxx
       brew install log4cxx

#.
   Install rviz dependencies

   .. code-block:: bash

       # install dependencies for Rviz
       brew install qt freetype assimp

       # Add the Qt directory to the PATH and CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
       export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH:/usr/local/opt/qt
       export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/opt/qt/bin

#.
   Use ``python3 -m pip`` (just ``pip`` may install Python3 or Python2) to install more stuff:

   .. code-block:: bash

       python3 -m pip install argcomplete catkin_pkg colcon-common-extensions coverage empy flake8 flake8-blind-except flake8-builtins flake8-class-newline flake8-comprehensions flake8-deprecated flake8-docstrings flake8-import-order flake8-quotes lark-parser mock nose pep8 pydocstyle pyparsing setuptools vcstool

#.
   *Optional*: if you want to build the ROS 1<->2 bridge, then you must also install ROS 1:


   * Start with the normal install instructions: http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/OSX/Homebrew/Source
   *
     When you get to the step where you call ``rosinstall_generator`` to get the source code, here's an alternate invocation that brings in just the minimum required to produce a useful bridge:

     .. code-block:: bash

          rosinstall_generator catkin common_msgs roscpp rosmsg --rosdistro kinetic --deps --wet-only --tar > kinetic-ros2-bridge-deps.rosinstall
          wstool init -j8 src kinetic-ros2-bridge-deps.rosinstall


     Otherwise, just follow the normal instructions, then source the resulting ``install_isolated/setup.bash`` before proceeding here to build ROS 2.

Disable System Integrity Protection (SIP)
-----------------------------------------

OS X versions >=10.11 have System Integrity Protection enabled by default.
So that SIP doesn't prevent processes from inheriting dynamic linker environment variables, such as ``DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH``, you'll need to disable it `following these instructions <https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Security/Conceptual/System_Integrity_Protection_Guide/ConfiguringSystemIntegrityProtection/ConfiguringSystemIntegrityProtection.html>`__.

Get the ROS 2 code
------------------

Create a workspace and clone all repos:

.. code-block:: bash

   mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
   cd ~/ros2_ws
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros2/ros2/release-latest/ros2.repos
   vcs import src < ros2.repos


.. note::

   If you want to get all of the latest bug fixes then you can try the "tip" of development by replacing ``release-latest`` in the url above with ``master``. The ``release-latest`` is preferred by default because it goes through more rigorous testing on release than changes to master do. See also `Maintaining a Source Checkout <Maintaining-a-Source-Checkout>`.


Install additional DDS vendors (optional)
-----------------------------------------

ROS 2 builds on top of DDS.
It is compatible with `multiple DDS or RTPS (the DDS wire protocol) vendors <../Concepts/DDS-and-ROS-middleware-implementations>`.
The repositories you downloaded for ROS 2 includes eProsima's Fast RTPS, which is the only bundled vendor.
If you would like to use one of the other vendors you will need to install their software separately before building.
The ROS 2 build will automatically build support for vendors that have been installed and sourced correctly.

By default we include eProsima's FastRTPS in the workspace and it is the default middleware.
Detailed instructions for installing other DDS vendors are provided in the "Alternative DDS sources" section below.

Build the ROS 2 code
--------------------

**Note**\ : if you are trying to build the ROS 1 <-> ROS 2 bridge, follow instead these `modified instructions <https://github.com/ros2/ros1_bridge/blob/master/README#build-the-bridge-from-source>`__.

Run the ``colcon`` tool to build everything (more on using ``colcon`` in `this tutorial <../Tutorials/Colcon-Tutorial>`):

.. code-block:: bash

   cd ~/ros2_ws/
   colcon build --symlink-install


Try some examples
-----------------

In a clean new terminal, source the setup file (this will automatically set up the environment for any DDS vendors that support was built for) and then run a ``talker``:

.. code-block:: bash

   . ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
   ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker


In another terminal source the setup file and then run a ``listener``:

.. code-block:: bash

   . ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
   ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp listener


You should see the ``talker`` saying that it's ``Publishing`` messages and the ``listener`` saying ``I heard`` those messages.
Hooray!

Alternative DDS sources
-----------------------

The demos will attempt to build against any detected DDS vendor.
The only bundled vendor is eProsima's Fast RTPS, which is included in the default set of sources for ROS 2.
If you would like to switch out the vendor below are the instructions.
When you run the build make sure that your chosen DDS vendor(s) are exposed in your environment.

When multiple vendors are present, you can choose the used RMW implementation by setting the the environment variable ``RMW_IMPLEMENTATION`` to the package providing the RMW implementation.
See `Working with multiple RMW implementations <../Tutorials/Working-with-multiple-RMW-implementations>` for more details.

Adlink OpenSplice
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ROS 2 Crystal Clemmys supports OpenSplice 6.9.
ROS 2 Bouncy Bolson supports OpenSplice 6.7.

To install OpenSplice, download the latest supported release from https://github.com/ADLINK-IST/opensplice/releases and unpack it.

Source the ``release.com`` file provided to set up the environment before building your ROS 2 workspace, e.g.:

.. code-block:: bash

   source <path_to_opensplice>/x86_64.darwin10_clang/release.com

RTI Connext (5.3)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To use RTI Connext you will need to have obtained a license from RTI.

You can install the OS X package of Connext version 5.3 provided by RTI from their `downloads page <https://www.rti.com/downloads>`__.

You also need a Java runtime installed to run the RTI code generator, which you can get `here <https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572?locale=en_US>`__.

After installing, run RTI launcher and point it to your license file.

Source the setup file to set the ``NDDSHOME`` environment variable before building your workspace.

The setup file and path will depend on your macOS version.

.. code-block:: bash

   # macOS 10.12 Sierra
   source /Applications/rti_connext_dds-5.3.1/resource/scripts/rtisetenv_x64Darwin16clang8.0.bash
   # macOS 10.13 High Sierra
   source /Applications/rti_connext_dds-5.3.1/resource/scripts/rtisetenv_x64Darwin17clang9.0.bash

You may need to increase shared memory resources following https://community.rti.com/kb/osx510.

If you want to install the Connext DDS-Security plugins please refer to `this page <Install-Connext-Security-Plugins>`.

Troubleshooting
---------------

Segmentation Fault when using ``pyenv``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``pyenv`` seems to default to building Python with ``.a`` files, but that causes issues with ``rclpy``, so it's recommended to build Python with Frameworks enabled on macOS when using ``pyenv``:

https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki#how-to-build-cpython-with-framework-support-on-os-x

Library not loaded; image not found
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are seeing library loading issues at runtime (either running tests or running nodes), such as the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   ImportError: dlopen(.../ros2_install/ros2-osx/lib/python3.7/site-packages/rclpy/_rclpy.cpython-37m-darwin.so, 2): Library not loaded: @rpath/librcl_interfaces__rosidl_typesupport_c.dylib
     Referenced from: .../ros2_install/ros2-osx/lib/python3.7/site-packages/rclpy/_rclpy.cpython-37m-darwin.so
     Reason: image not found

then you probably have System Integrity Protection enabled.
See "Disable System Integrity Protection (SIP)" above for how instructions on how to disable it.

Qt build errors e.g. ``unknown type name 'Q_ENUM'``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you see build errors related to Qt, e.g.:

.. code-block:: bash

   In file included from /usr/local/opt/qt/lib/QtGui.framework/Headers/qguiapplication.h:46:
   /usr/local/opt/qt/lib/QtGui.framework/Headers/qinputmethod.h:87:5: error:
         unknown type name 'Q_ENUM'
       Q_ENUM(Action)
       ^

you may be using qt4 instead of qt5: see https://github.com/ros2/ros2/issues/441

Missing symbol when opencv (and therefore libjpeg, libtiff, and libpng) are installed with Homebrew
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you have opencv installed you might get this:

.. code-block:: bash

   dyld: Symbol not found: __cg_jpeg_resync_to_restart
     Referenced from: /System/Library/Frameworks/ImageIO.framework/Versions/A/ImageIO
     Expected in: /usr/local/lib/libJPEG.dylib
    in /System/Library/Frameworks/ImageIO.framework/Versions/A/ImageIO
   /bin/sh: line 1: 25274 Trace/BPT trap: 5       /usr/local/bin/cmake

If so, to build you'll have to do this:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ brew unlink libpng libtiff libjpeg

But this will break opencv, so you'll also need to update it to continue working:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo install_name_tool -change /usr/local/lib/libjpeg.8.dylib /usr/local/opt/jpeg/lib/libjpeg.8.dylib /usr/local/lib/libopencv_highgui.2.4.dylib
   $ sudo install_name_tool -change /usr/local/lib/libpng16.16.dylib /usr/local/opt/libpng/lib/libpng16.16.dylib /usr/local/lib/libopencv_highgui.2.4.dylib
   $ sudo install_name_tool -change /usr/local/lib/libtiff.5.dylib /usr/local/opt/libtiff/lib/libtiff.5.dylib /usr/local/lib/libopencv_highgui.2.4.dylib
   $ sudo install_name_tool -change /usr/local/lib/libjpeg.8.dylib /usr/local/opt/jpeg/lib/libjpeg.8.dylib /usr/local/Cellar/libtiff/4.0.4/lib/libtiff.5.dylib

The first command is necessary to avoid things built against the system libjpeg (etc.) from getting the version in /usr/local/lib.
The others are updating things built by Homebrew so that they can find the version of libjpeg (etc.) without having them in /usr/local/lib.
