This page explains how to install ROS 2 on OS X from a pre-built binary package.

System requirements
-------------------

We support OS X El Capitan and Sierra (10.11.x and 10.12.x).

.. _osx-install-binary-installling-prerequisites:

Installing prerequisites
------------------------

You need the following things installed before installing ROS 2.


*
  **brew** *(needed to install more stuff; you probably already have this)*:


  * Follow installation instructions at http://brew.sh/
  *
    *Optional*: Check that ``brew`` is happy with your system configuration by running:

    .. code-block:: bash

        brew doctor


      Fix any problems that it identifies.

*
  Use ``brew`` to install more stuff:

  .. code-block:: bash

       brew install python3

       # install asio and tinyxml2 for Fast-RTPS
       brew install asio tinyxml2

       # install dependencies for robot state publisher
       brew install tinyxml eigen pcre poco

       # OpenCV isn't a dependency of ROS 2, but it is used by some demos.
       brew install opencv

       # install OpenSSL for DDS-Security
       brew install openssl

       # install Qt for RViz
       brew install qt freetype assimp

       # install dependencies for rcl_logging_log4cxx
       brew install log4cxx

*
  Install rqt dependencies

  ``brew install sip pyqt5``

  Fix some path names when looking for sip stuff during install (see `ROS 1 wiki <http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/OSX/Homebrew/Source#Qt_naming_issue>`__):

  ``ln -s /usr/local/share/sip/Qt5 /usr/local/share/sip/PyQt5``

  ``brew install graphviz``
  ``python3 -m pip install pygraphviz pydot``

*
  Install SROS2 dependencies

  ``python3 -m pip install lxml``

*
  Install additional runtime dependencies for command-line tools:

  .. code-block:: bash

       python3 -m pip install catkin_pkg empy lark-parser pyparsing pyyaml setuptools argcomplete

Disable System Integrity Protection (SIP)
-----------------------------------------

OS X versions >=10.11 have System Integrity Protection enabled by default.
So that SIP doesn't prevent processes from inheriting dynamic linker environment variables, such as ``DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH``, you'll need to disable it `following these instructions <https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Security/Conceptual/System_Integrity_Protection_Guide/ConfiguringSystemIntegrityProtection/ConfiguringSystemIntegrityProtection.html>`__.

Downloading ROS 2
-----------------


* Go to the releases page: https://github.com/ros2/ros2/releases
* Download the latest package for OS X; let's assume that it ends up at ``~/Downloads/ros2-release-distro-date-macos-amd64.tar.bz2``.

  * Note: there may be more than one binary download option which might cause the file name to differ.

*
  Unpack it:

  .. code-block:: bash

       mkdir -p ~/ros2_install
       cd ~/ros2_install
       tar xf ~/Downloads/ros2-release-distro-date-macos-amd64.tar.bz2

Install additional DDS implementations (optional)
-------------------------------------------------

ROS 2 builds on top of DDS.
It is compatible with multiple DDS or RTPS (the DDS wire protocol) vendors.

*For ROS 2 Bouncy and newer:*

The package you downloaded has been built with *optional* support for three vendors.
Run-time support for eProsima's Fast RTPS is included bundled by default.
If you would like to use one of the other vendors you will need to install their software separately.

*For ROS 2 Ardent and older:*

If you downloaded a package that includes support for OpenSplice, you must install OpenSplice as detailed below.

Enable OpenSplice support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Download the latest release from https://github.com/ADLINK-IST/opensplice/releases and unpack it.
For ROS 2 releases up to and including Ardent, do not do anything else at this point.
For ROS 2 releases later than Ardent, set the ``OSPL_HOME`` environment variable to the unpacked directory that contains the ``release.com`` script.

Enable Connext support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To use RTI Connext you will need to have obtained a license from RTI.

You can install the OS X package of Connext version 5.3.1 provided by RTI from their `downloads page <https://www.rti.com/downloads>`__.

After installing, run RTI launcher and point it to your license file.

Set the ``NDDSHOME`` environment variable:

.. code-block:: bash

   export NDDSHOME=/Applications/rti_connext_dds-5.3.1

You may need to increase shared memory resources following https://community.rti.com/kb/osx510.

If you want to install the Connext DDS-Security plugins please refer to `this page <Install-Connext-Security-Plugins>`.

Set up the ROS 2 environment
----------------------------

Source the ROS 2 setup file:

.. code-block:: bash

   . ~/ros2_install/ros2-osx/setup.bash


For ROS 2 releases up to and including Ardent, if you downloaded a release with OpenSplice support you must additionally source the OpenSplice setup file manually (this is done automatically for ROS 2 releases later than Ardent).
Only do this **after** you have sourced the ROS 2 one:

.. code-block:: bash

   . <path_to_opensplice>/x86_64.darwin10_clang/release.com



Try some examples
-----------------

In one terminal, set up the ROS 2 environment as described above and then run a ``talker``:

.. code-block:: bash

   ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker


In another terminal, set up the ROS 2 environment and then run a ``listener``:

.. code-block:: bash

   ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp listener


You should see the ``talker`` saying that it's ``Publishing`` messages and the ``listener`` saying ``I heard`` those messages.
Hooray!

If you have installed support for an optional vendor, see `this page <../Tutorials/Working-with-multiple-RMW-implementations>` for details on how to use that vendor.

If you run into issues, see `the troubleshooting section <osx-development-setup-troubleshooting>` on the source installation page.

Build your own packages
-----------------------

If you would like to build your own packages, refer to the tutorial `"Using Colcon to build packages" <../Tutorials/Colcon-Tutorial>`.
